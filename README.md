link is for the folder which has videos for all assignment.<br/></p><hr>
<p>asssignment1.py is the source code for assignment1<br/>
readme.pdf is the explanation for assignment1.<br/> </p><hr>
<p>assignment2.ipynb is the source code for assignment2<br/></p><hr>
<p>assignment3 question1 is the source code for question 1 in assignment 3.</br>
assignment3 question2 is the source code for question 2 in assignment 3.</br>
Train and test.csv is the dataset for assignment 3 question 1 and glass.csv is the data set for assignment 3 question 2.</br>
In assignment 3 question 1 first there is a correlation between ‘survived’ and ‘sex’ column for the Titanic dataset. And visualizations to show correlations,then there is a implementation of  Naive Bayes method using scikit-learn library and accuracy of that algorithm.</br> In question 2 there is a implimentation of all naive bayes algorithm for dataset 'glass' and implimenetation of SVM. visualizations to better describe correlations in the Glass Dataset.</P></br><hr>
<p>In assignment4 folder there are 2 source code 1 for question1 and other is for question 2 and 3 and for both question required dataset is also provided in the folder.In question 1 Linear Regression is applied on dataset salary_data.csv. In question 2  K means clustering is applied on dataset K-Mean_dataset and Silhouette score is calculated and in question 3 feature scaling is done on same dataset after that Silhouette score is calculated.</p></br>
<p> In assignment5 folder there are 3 source code 1 for question1 and 1 for question 2 and 1 for question 3 and 4 together. There is also a folder for dataset and explanation.pdf file is provided which has screenshots of the code and explanation of the code.</p></br>
