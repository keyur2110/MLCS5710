link is for the folder which has videos for both assignment.<br/></p>
<p>asssignment1.py is the source code for assignment1<br/>
readme.pdf is the explanation for assignment1.<br/> </p>
<p>assignment2.ipynb is the source code for assignment2<br/></p>
<p>assignment3 question1 is the source code for question 1 in assignment 3.</br>
assignment3 question2 is the source code for question 2 in assignment 3.</br>
Train and test.csv is the dataset for assignment 3 question 1 and glass.csv is the data set for assignment 3 question 2.</br>
In assignment 3 question 1 first there is a correlation between ‘survived’ and ‘sex’ column for the Titanic dataset. And visualizations to show correlations,then there is a implementation of  Naive Bayes method using scikit-learn library and accuracy of that algorithm.</br> In question 2 there is a implimentation of all naive bayes algorithm for dataset 'glass' and implimenetation of SVM. visualizations to better describe correlations in the Glass Dataset.</P>
